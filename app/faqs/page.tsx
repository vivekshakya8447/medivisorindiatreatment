II. Talk to the doctor: Let us know if you'd like to speak with the doctor, and we'll connect you with the appropriate specialist to discuss the treatment plan and expected outcomes.

III. Book a ticket: Send us these documents, and we'll arrange your visa. You can then book your flight, or if you prefer, we can book it for you. Depending on your condition, you may need flying clearance from the airline, which your travel agent can help arrange.

IV. Fly to India: Once you arrive in India, we handle everything else, including airport pickup, hotel accommodations, hospital visits, currency exchange, and local SIM cards. A dedicated staff member will assist you throughout your stay.`,
